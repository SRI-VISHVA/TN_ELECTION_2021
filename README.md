# E-Voting Application using smart contracts 
## A blockchain dapp (decentralized application)

## TN ELECTION BLOCKCHAIN APPLICATION 2021

## This project was done by Sri Vishwa E and Niharika Gupta for the Blockchain-CSE1003 course

### Abstract
Smart contracts are trackable and irreversible applications that execute in a decentralized environment (e.g., blockchain). Once the smart contract has been deployed nobody can edit the code or change its execution behavior. Smart contract execution guarantees to bind parties together to an agreement as written. This creates a new powerful type of trust relationship that does not rely on a single party. Smart contracts enable better management for realizing and administering digital agreements because they are self-verifying and self-executing. <br/>
<b>In this project we will be creating a Decentralized Voting App using smart contracts. The use of blockchain in such an application would eliminate the need of third party apps thus increasing security which leverages the unique characteristics of the blockchain network.</b>

### How to run this 
- Download and install [Ganache](https://www.trufflesuite.com/ganache) using which you can Quickly fire up a personal Ethereum blockchain which you can use to run tests, execute commands, and inspect state while controlling how the chain operates.<br>
- - This gives you access to the Truffle suit which is needed to run the blockchain. Start it!
- On your browser download the [Metamask](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/metamask/nkbihfbeogaeaoehlefnkodbefgpgknn?hl=en) Extension
- - Activate it by typing the secret para phrase provided and connect it to the host of your Ganache Truffle suit <hr>
- Download our code 
- Run the following commands <br/>
- - `npm i` to install all the dependencies
- - `truffle compile` to compile it
- - `truffle migrate` to migrate it 
- - `npm run dev` to start the chain. <hr>

Now connect the account on metamask by using the private key of the account from ganache and vote for your candidate! <hr>
